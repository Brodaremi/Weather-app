## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Search and view the weather details update of their cities in real-time
- Get the background of the page with corresponding images relating to the name of cities searched
- Live change in location as the user types in the location into the search bar
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The city name is not found by the API
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page
